# Alcohol-Sales-Prediction
LSTM and SARIMA for time series predictions

Implementing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks to predict the monthly sales of alcohol given previous sales. For this particular 
dataset, we modify the original LSTM method by using a different normalization technique, which yields significantly better results. We also build 
a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model for short-term predictions and also for long-range forecasting.
